140,"So I am a completely stuck on a decision and am looking for some insight (hopefully unbiased).

While I am relatively new to photography, I have been shooting Nikon on and off for 5 years.  I started with a D3200 but would only shoot occasionally.   About a year ago I was offered a deal on a D750 I couldn't pass up.  At the same time I added to my lenses, which now include:

35mm, 50mm, 85mm, 24-120, 70-300, Tokina 100mm Macro, and a Tamron 70-200.

I started looking at selling the 70-300 and the 24-120 and to start saving for a wide angle lens when I started looking at mirrorless.  While I enjoy the d750, it isn't great for shooting my daughter playing soccer (especially shit for shooting video of it), and I find I am only getting about a 60% hit rate on focus for moving targets.  Some of that would be my skill, but this seems to be a common issue on the d750 as well.  For portraits it is great, but I am starting to get into street photography and I am finding that I would enjoy a lighter and more compact camera for this.

I started looking at the Z6 and Z7, but they really didn't excite me too much.  I have a friend with a Z6, whom is a huge Nikon fan, and he is pretty down on his.  Their native lens lineup isn't too great yet.  That isn't too much of a concern with the F2Z adapter, but I have read a lot of people complain about the slower autofocus.

So I started looking at other options, figuring the 1 time I would be willing to switch camera brands would be when I go mirrorless.  For a myriad of reasons that aren't important, I don't want to go Sony.

I did, however, get pretty excited about the EOS R.  Reviewers seem to like it, for the most part.  The lenses are amazing, but pricey.  Their adaptor for the ef lenses gets really good reviews.  I know there are limitations, no ibis, apparently no one sees a use for the touch bar, and the video crop is something to be concerned about.  However, it seems Canon is on a much better path on the mirrorless front than Nikon.  

So I guess my question is, am I being foolish in swapping brands?  Is the EOS R a good camera for my use case?  Has anyone else swapped brands for the R?

179,"Hi,

I'm currently looking into expanding my video setup. Up until now, I've been using ...

* Sony PXW X70
* Canon M50
* Canon Powershot G7 Mark III

Each camera has their pros and cons. Now I'm looking for a camera that has all the pros, but no cons. What I'm looking for is:

* A good and reliable Auto Focus (M50 has it - Sony and Powershot both ""pump"" all the time and the autofocus is terrible)

I'm currently looking into expanding my video setup. Up until now, I've been using ...

* Sony PXW X70
* Canon M50
* Canon Powershot G7 Mark III

Each camera has their pros and cons. Now I'm looking for a camera that has all the pros, but no cons. What I'm looking for is:

* A good and reliable Auto Focus (M50 has it - Sony and Powershot both ""pump"" all the time and the autofocus is terrible)
* Clean HDMI out (Powershot has it - M50 only if you go for manual focus, which is suboptimal)
* no limit on recording time (Sony has it; this is negotiable and not a total must, but would be really NICE)

219,"Alternate thread title: ""Thanks COVID-19!"" (You'll see why in a minute)

I'm finally back in the full frame game! My photography hobby began with the Canon T4i for a couple of years then progressed to the Canon 6D. I adored the 6D, but after a few years of shooting with it, the weight started to bother me and with the progression of mirrorless cameras, I decided to give the Canon M50 a try. I found exactly what my aching wrist needed in the lesser weight and size, but after a couple of years with it, I felt like I was missing a full frame. I didn't want to move away from mirrorless, so the search began for my next body. 

After reading countless reviews, watching countless YouTube videos, and reading tons of thread here and on POTN, I narrowed it down to the RP, R, or I could wait it out for the R5 (or R6). After seeing the likely prices on the R5, which I'm not griping about because as much technology as Canon appears to be packing into that body, the prices are justified, I decided to narrow it down to the RP and R. 

I'd been contemplating the refurbished R from Canon and once the current 10% off sale began, I decided to call Canon Sales and join the loyalty program. I gave them the serial # of my M50, was told there was no need to send it in (which I'd already read was the case), and after an additional 10% off the sale price, I bought the R body for just below $1400 with tax included. Needless to say, I'm extremely happy with that price! Side note, back in the day when I bought my 6D new, I paid right at $1500 for it with the 24-105L kit lens (which I still have and use all the time). 

The body arrived this morning and the first thing I noticed was how right all the YouTube reviewers were about the comfortable grip. This thing feels like it was made for my hand. But then I noticed something I didn't expect...how light the body is. Obviously, this is without a lens, but upon first impressions, it feels way lighter than the 6D body, so that's great for me. I'm going to assume it's because the 6D had a full magnesium frame and was built like a tank. 

Now, on to the alternate thread title. Seeing as how I bought only the body and no RF lens to go with it, I knew I'd need the Canon adapter to be able to use my existing EF lenses (that I've been using on the M50 with the adapter, happily, for the last couple of years). About 5 minutes after I bought the camera body from Canon, I purchased the adapter online from Best Buy, mainly because I had $25 in Best Buy points that I could use. Boy, was that a mistake.

The adapter was showing as in-stock, but only for shipping. Great, I thought. I'm an Elite member at Best Buy...2-day shipping included! I'll probably have the adapter before the camera shows up! 

I bought both on Monday around mid-day. By Tuesday afternoon, I had a shipping notification from Canon and a tracking number. 4 days later...today...I have the EOS R body in my hands. 

As we sit here, the adapter from Best Buy is still ""preparing to ship"" after 4 days. After chatting with Best Buy support, it seems COVID-19 has disrupted a lot of their warehouses (which, let me be clear, is completely understandable). So, thanks COVID-19 for making me sit here indefinitely with a new camera body and **no way to shoot a single picture with it!**

But that's ok. I plan on spending the weekend watching more videos and getting myself acquainted with the myriad of options the EOS R has that the M50 doesn't. But I'm super excited and I can't wait to see how much fun I'll have for the next few years on this bad boy!

284,"I have been considering upgrading my camera body for a while, between being happy with canon products and not wanting to replace my existing lenses and gear I want to remain in the Canon ecosystem.

Initially, I had felt the 6D MK II would be a nice upgrade, I know a lot of the critics weren't the happiest with this camera but coming from the 70d, it looked like this would be a solid upgrade. Things like the 5D MK IV were a little high in price and I figured the savings could be put towards more glass. However, I know mirrorless is the next biggest thing and a lot of other discussions point towards the EOS RP/R as the better choice, so I just wanted to pose a few questions here about which to buy and some extra questions regarding mirrorless cameras. Mirrorless questions:

 
1. **Am I right in my understanding that the EF-adapter would work with both EF and EF-S lenses?** Are there any noticeable drawbacks to this adapter?
2. **What are the viewfinders like to use on mirrorless cameras?** I've watched a couple of videos on the EVF and they seem fine but I wonder what people's real-world experience is like. Is there any lag when trying to shoot fast-moving wildlife for example?

Now on to selecting a camera.

What I want/shoot:

* Landscape photography primarily, especially at sunset and dusk - this is probably where I have maxed out my 70d the most, as I really want less noise in my low light photography
* Wildlife and Macro photography
* Occasional videos
* General settings - shoot raw, everything manual mode. Usually AF - I've heard the AF is a real drawback on the 6d MK II, with all of the points clustered together
* Camera will be used in all weather conditions
* Preference is for good battery life and weight isn't really an issue
* While I could live without my 70d's flippy screen, it would be sorely missed - I think I am right in saying that all cameras here have this


So I see the options as (with Amazon price just for reference, I'd shop around before purchasing):

* Canon 6d MK II - £1349
* Canon EOS RP - £1299
* Canon EOS R - £1999 (at a stretch if it is worth it over the RP, which it looks it to me)

Any advice is greatly appreciated, or if you have a better suggestion I am open to it.

Aside from the 570p issue (is it really an problem?

I do not have this issue with 1080p/30 but obs does not run 1080p/30 smoothly for some reason. 1080p/60 is smooth as glass however. Any work around for this? Does anyone else have a similar experience? When feeling the camera it does not feel warm whatsoever. I have tried various shutter speeds, shooting in auto and manual, and many other settings.

I have recently been doing bird photography etc and i'm struggling to get sharp images of moving subjects and im also struggling in the low light, the camera is having to shoot at 3200 and 6400 which is quite a bit above the 1600 i'd normally think of as my maximum iso to prevent grain

I'd love to go full frame for the low light capabilities but I'm also conscious of budget, crop factor being beneficial for wildlife photography and budget concerns.

I've been looking at the 7d mk2 but I'm wondering if theres some used more budget middle ground - i'll probably be doing some more gig photography this year but movie recording isn't super important to me as I definitely prefer stills. 

I have a tonne of lenses that I don't own but will have for the foreseeable future, the 70-200 for example but i don't find it to be close enough for birds and smaller animals.  I also have a 75-300 but its f5.6 and practically useless in forests.

336,"Hello all,

I'm about to bite the bullet and sell off my 18-55 for either of the aforementioned lenses. I'm torn though between the two. Do I get the Tokina which is 2mm less wide but has a constant F4 OR the 10-18 which lacks 6mm at the long end but has IS and is a Canon product? The Tokina also strikes me a bit better because I have a 24-70 so the focal lengths match up a bit better than 18-24.

367,"Hi guys

So I just did it. I did somehow scratch my sensor while cleaning it. I guess scratched the front glass of it not the sensor itself. It barely seeable if you know where to look at f8. It gets more and more prone from f11 to f22 if u shoot let's say in the blue sky. On a ""normal"" photo it's not seeable at all.

Before I forget - it is a 250d / SL3

I guess replacing the sensor front glass will be quite expensive for a 250d. I don't think it makes sense from the money site of things.

I think I should just man up, eat it and live with my failure.

423,"Newbie to telephoto questions

So for about a year I’ve been shooting with a 75-300, and I decided I’d like something that can shoot a bit further. I found a fully manual 500mm but I have some questions: 

1. The listing says that this lens requires a t mount. Do I need to look for a mount that specifies that it is 58mm filter size (my camera is 58)? Or does any “canon t mount” work?

2. the filter size on this lens is 67mm. With a t mount on, do I need to be concerned about the difference between my cameras filter size and the lens filter size? Do I HAVE to find a lens that specifies that it is 58? 

I know these questions are probably very basic to you experienced photographers, but any help is appreciated.",1,Newbie telephoto questions,"Newbie to telephoto questions

TLDR: Moving away from Canon 60D to something lighter mainly for travel. What should I get, and can/should I keep my current lenses?

I have had my Canon 60D for a long time, and while it has been a very good camera, and still takes awesome photos, I feel that it is too heavy to carry around on vacations, which is primarily when I'm using my camera (maybe the weight is also the reason I just don't use it that much in general anymore..).  
I am considering getting a smaller camera that is more convenient for travel, but I still appreciate being able to take good quality photos, mainly street, low light and landscape. I have two canon lenses that I think are brilliant, and I'm wondering if there is a good way to use these as alternative lenses for a smaller camera, although neither have a small form factor and I probably wouldnt carry these with me all the time - alternatively I could sell all the gear that I currently have.

I have been looking at **Fuji X-T20** or X-T30, and it seems nice, but I'm wondering if the form factor with the 18-55mm is convenient for travel, or if I should go for something even smaller. Alternatives around the same size would be the **Canon M6 mkii** or Sony a6400, but judging from what I have read, the Fuji edges both of these for my current needs. I have not had time to see any of the cameras in a store.

Has anyone made a similar move, and if so, do you have any recommendations? Budget is 1000-1500$.

In this days of lock down am trying to get some star trails photographs merging 200+ pictures; only limit is the camera can shoot maximum 10 pictures in self timed setting, with 10 seconds delay.
I was thinking to get either a Pluto or an Arsenal external trigger but neither are usable with my camera.
Are there any similar products that will allow me to do the same (even more than multiple shots) compatible?
Any help will be appreciated.

Girlfriend just got a secondhand Canon EOS 400D, and is getting Error 99. I've been to multiple sites that suggest cleaning contacts, resetting etc. I've done all of this but with no luck so I've been troubleshooting myself.

It seems to only have a problem when shooting with a higher aperture value. It seems to work okay on 5 for example, but put it any higher and it refuses to shoot. The camera also shoots without error without the lens attached.

Is there anything I can do about this? Living in the UK, I can't just pop down to a camera shop with everything closed down unfortunately.

669,"Hi all,

I dug an old Canon SX610 HS of a cupboard, as I thought I might as well learn something about photography while I'm locked down! Unfortunately, I can't get it to out of Auto mode, and I don't really understand why....

I performed a factory reset, and have then been following the instructions from the manual (which are the same as [here](https://support.usa.canon.com/kb/index?page=content&amp;id=ART117253&amp;cat=9340B&amp;actp=LIST)). Unfortunately, when I get to step 3, the manual says I should get a menu like [this](https://support.usa.canon.com/library/attachments/CanonUSA/TroubleshootingContents/Images/Global/G0177338.gif), but I actually just get [this](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4fbbfaf1772604fd7d198892861cd92b/bbb6447a71cfcf1b-c2/s2048x3072/8f5efaff7e3288e2564e710aa1241760e6865129.jpg). The only options that I can change here are the self timer and movie quality. I think I last used the camera about 3 years ago, and was definitely able to change the mode back then, so I don't really understand why my beautiful options have disappeared!

I have done some googling and haven't found anybody else with the same issue, but I thought perhaps I was phrasing it wrong so I'd ask. Does anybody have any idea whatthe problem is likely to be here? Or no anywhere that I should think about asking?

I recorded a YouTube video, and after I put the footage on my PC, a few parts of it appeared to be glitched out. I played the footage back again on my camera and it's just fine. Could it be that I'm using an older and somewhat beat-up SD card? It's an 80 Mb/s Sandisk Pixtor. Do let me know what the issue could possibly be!

EDIT: I've tried recording footage with a much better SD card and the issue still persists. What's frustrating is that now it glitches in random parts until I import the footage in Premiere and then it glitches in the same exact spots every time. I'm beyond frustrated.

692,"So, my dad gifted my a new 70-200 f2.8 for Easter. Before that, i´ve been using his 80-200 2.8 built in 1991 (aka. ""Magic Drainpipe""). Now, after two weeks i want to share some of my thoughts and impression of the diffrences, tops and flops of each lens.

NOTE: I didn´t got to shoot any sports with the new lens, so this is only what i noticed so far in slower paced sceneries.

First, the thing that immedatliy stroke to my eyes was, hell, the 70-200 is bigger and a bit heavier than the MagicDrainpipe. The second thing, which is a con for me, is that the lens-mount doesnt flip open to the side. So on the Magic Drainpipe, you unscrewed it and open it up without having to remove it from the body. Why they changed it, idk... It sucks form my excperience.

So, than what is it like to shoot?! Well, it doesn´t feel that diffrent, evenknow that the zoomring is a bit smaller, and the space between the lens and the camera is on the oher hand wider, making it actually easier to zoom....wouldn´t there by the screws of the before mentioned lens mount.

Optically, you see the nearly 20yr of developent. It is a bit sharper wide open, which is caused, so my thoughts by the wider apeture of the sweetspot. Talking about that, it was on the 80-200 around f/13, which was pretty closed for an non-stabilized lens. On the 70-200 on the other hand it sits around f/5.6, which is pretty handy.

So finally, what do i think. Well, the 70-200 is better, but if i would have the justify a lens...and i would read this to myself having not either of them, i would suggest myself the 70-200. Why, on ebay a 80-200 is around 450€, the 70-200 around 550€.

My favourite lens was the Fujifilm 35mm f/1.4 (APS-C) before I switched to Canon and that lens was amazing in the sense that the images really pop with great character and micro-contrast (which is something the RF35 lacks imo). I enjoyed shooting it wide open and the images are always sharp in the centre with pleasing bokeh. 

Could anyone recommend a 50mm lens for my RP with good character (distinctive look / micro-contrast) and reasonably sharp wide open except the RF 50mm f/1.2 which is way too expensive and too heavy? Something that performs like the Fujifilm 35mm f/1.4 on the Canon side?

I’ve borrowed the tiny EF50mm f/1.8 STM from a friend briefly but felt that lens was not sharp at all wide open (not sure if it’s because I missed focus or if that lens was meant to be soft in the centre wide open...)

778,"So I have recently come across some communication issues with the RP and third part lenses and speed lights. 

I have had my eye on the Godox AD200 Pro for a while, but given my recent experiences, I’m hesitant to order one in case it shows up and I have issues again. 
So the question is, has any of you used the AD200 Pro - RP combo and have you had any issues with it? Or do they work perfectly together in all scenarios? 

The issues I have had is with my Sigma 50mm f1.4. When using speedlites in TTL mode and shooting the lens wide open, something happens with the metering and the image underexposes by around 7 stops. Once I get to f2, it starts to improve. f2.8 is acceptable and f4 is perfect. Same thing happens with Yongnuo 50mm f1.8. But that one never exposes, no matter what aperture I shoot it at. 
Using the flash manual is of course fine. So it is all down to the communication between the lens and the body and how it effects the metering in this particular setting. 

The other issue I found was when using Neewer NE680 speedlights. If I’m focusing on a subject closer than 1m on the cameras distance reading, it will underexpose around 4-5 stops. As soon as I increase the distance from camera to subject to above 1m, It will expose perfectly. This happens with both RF and EF glass. Swap the speed light for a Canon 600EX II-RT and the problem goes away. So a communication thing between the camera and the third party flash. 

Appreciate any info.",1,Godox AD200 Pro with EOS RP - any experience with this combination?,"So I have recently come across some communication issues with the RP and third part lenses and speed lights.

780,"I am simply curious and open for discussion as to what you guys think of the Canon Ivy Rec, at least those of you that have tried one. 

My take:

I'll give some context as to what I use Canon cameras for. I a young, aspiring filmmaker who also enjoys capturing and editing photos. My first real camera was a SL2, which was later demoted to my secondary camera when I upgrade to the M50. I don't think that gear is everything, but it definitely helps. For Christmas 2019 I asked for the Ivy Rec for a few reasons: it was cheap, looked fun, why not?

So, what do I think of it so far? I'll be honest, I used it pretty sparingly when I first got it. I had also received some accessories for my M50 so I was spending a lot of time playing around with those. In the last few months I have kept the Ivy Rec in my pocket almost everywhere I have gone, just in case. Even though I have a Samsung S10, which takes great photos, it was nice to have a camera that I wasn't terrified of dropping (I've broken a few phones), and one that I wasn't always looking at the photo after the fact. It's the definition of point and shoot. I heard some had troubles with the app, and initially I did too. Thankfully, Canon released a few software/firmware updates and things seem to work a lot better now. I found it worked smoothly when I manually connected my WiFi to the camera (Samsung multitasking came in handy).

I know you all want to know about one thing: performance. In well lit areas, the photos come out very nicely. Not nice enough to truly impress anyone, but far from bad. I took similar pictures of my dog with both the Ivy Rec and my S10. While the S10 looked sharper, the vibrance of its photos were a bit much, at least for an unedited photo. That's where I think the Ivy Rec stayed true to the Canon name, the colours. They weren't mind-boggingly amazing. Nothing on this camera is. But the colours of the sky were much truer to life. It isn't all peachy though. As with pretty much all cameras, especially at this price range, low light situations usually result in lower quality photos and videos. This is true for the Ivy Rec. It is very true. Without a flash, the Ivy Rec takes photos that are near unusable in poor lighting conditions. While this is definitely a downfall, this camera begs to be taken out on walks or hikes. I have found myself taking it with me even when I'm going to shoot on a much higher quality camera. There's a novelty in looking through a square carabiner clip to frame your shot (I recommend using the app to change the aspect ratio to 1:1, it makes the square cutout make a lot more sense). It brings a childlike joy to go out and snap a bunch of pictures, not knowing how they turned out until later.

The video is actually pretty rewarding, provided good lighting. Out the box it films in 720p, in 2020 that's just not gonna cut it. In the Canon MiniCam app you can change the quality to 1080p at either 30 or 60 frames. Respectable. I would absolutely love a firmware update to allow for 24 frames as I shoot almost strictly in 24, even if I would be shocked if I used Ivy Rec footage in something serious. The video quality, and audio quality for that matter, truly surprised me with how decent it looked. This may have been because I wasn't expecting anything at all, but regardless, it would be the kind of camera you can take with you on an amusement park ride. Vlogging isn't ideal due to the lack of a viewfinder, but with some practice I'm sure you can figure out the best angle for vlogging if you really wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

(My) Verdict:

The Ivy Rec has grown on me over time and has earned its spot in my pocket next to my wallet, ready to go at a moments notice. As long as the lighting is fair, it will perform well enough for what it is, so long as you don't expect DSLR or DSLM quality. If you want a fun, little camera that makes you rethink the process of taking a photo, look into the Ivy Rec.

Thanks for reading this review thing, I think I was fair to this camera considering all it has going for it (size, price, purpose).

852,"Hi all,

In 2015 we bought a Canon Vixia HF G30 cancorder to record sermons at our church. It's worked faithfully week in and week out ever since. Today, after pre-recording tomorrow's service, I went to swap SD cards like normal. (I have two cards I rotate so I can leave one card in the camera at all times).

The card will NOT stay depressed in Slot A. It just pushes up as if there's no latch whatsoever. I can move the same card over to Slot B, and it stays depressed nicely.

If it ends up being broken, is there any way to tell the camera to record off Slot B as the primary instead? I tried doing that. But, it keeps telling me that Slot A is empty.

And if I can't bypass Slot A, can I hook it up to a laptop by HDMI, and record to the computer instead? Or is it going to still demand a card in Slot A?

Unfortunately, Canon's West Coast repair center is closed for the duration of the COVID-19 lock down, so I would need to send it to Virginia if it needed repairs, which means I wouldn't have it for Easter Sunday.

Any suggestions on getting this thing to work?

So I am I guess you would say an intermediate user. I mostly do pet photography and have been using it as a side gig to my full time job. 

Here are some of my photos :)

I’ve had my current camera, the Rebel T5 for about I wanna say 5 years now. It’s a good camera and all but I always feel like clients have better equipment than I do 😂. I even had a client say to me that she was surprised I was using the T5 as it’s a beginners camera. 

Any who... I was thinking about switching to a full frame camera instead of my crop sensor. Only problem is the lenses I have are for crop sensors or so I’ve been told by my camera shop guy.  

I currently have:
Sigma DC 17-70mm 1:2.8-4.5
Canon EF 50mm 1:1.8
Canon kit lens EFS 18-55mm
Canon EF 55-200mm 
Canon EF 75-300mm 

I guess what I’m wondering is if it is worth it to upgrade? Should I keep my lenses and T5 as a back up? 

Any recommendations on cameras? Or lens?",1,Thinking about upgrading to full frame,"Hey guys,

When i say that the LCD doesn't work, i mean in the way that the backlight is on, but there is no picture. 

As you can see in the picture the LCD backlight is on, but no picture. I have recording mode ON which should mean that the LCD should be on aswell

978,Hey there hoping you all could provide a little insight as I’m looking to upgrade my camera body in the near future. I’ve narrowed it down to the 7D Mk II and the 5D Mk III. I would say my main concern and reason for wanting to upgrade is low light performance. I know full frames perform better in this area as a general rule of thumb but I can’t seem to figure out if the difference in performance between these two bodies is that significant when it comes to low light performance. Does the performance really justify the difference in price is what I’m wondering?

There is no damage to LCD screen (I can view menu and photos with no discoloration). I can adjust all menu settings. I can hold the shutter and while looking through the viewfinder, auto focus on a subject. Taking a picture produces that sweet shutter sound.

But there are two problems. The image saved is completely black. When I try to view the image through the LCD and not the viewfinder, it is also completely black.

Now if you want a few more details. Right after the camera fell, the image through the LCD had a red/purple tint and it was saving photos as such, with a red/purple tint. Hiking back and after my ride home, the LCD then showed a completely black photo and was saving a completely black photo.

1047,"Hey folks.

As a quick background, im a photography noob. I've done a good amount of working on footage (i.e. matchmoving for VFX, digital compositing, etc), but i've only ever really used existing footage, not my own. My experience with photography is basically my phone camera. 

Previously i've not been able to justify buying a DSLR, however over time i've grown to accept the fact that i probably will want one anyway, and so i seek advice in regards to which camera to buy (note: for PERSONAL use, not work use).

My ""wishlist"" of features is:

* HDR support. Id like to be able to tinker with images in post-editing, and having access to HDR would help.
* 4k photo support - i dont really see a reason to have DSLR that can't take 4k photos. I dont know if that's a standard thing for DSLRs or not, but figured i'd mention it just in case. 
* Will be mostly photo camera, so any video stuff is ""bonus"" but not required.
* Will be taking photos of: Urban, Nature, cities at night, animals (read: my cat mostly), miniatures (think warhammer).
* Something that's realistic for a beginner to learn
* Budget around £1k, but flexible. Prefer cheaper (since im not a ""pro user""), but can go a bit above if there's a justifiable good reason to do so.
* If possible and/or relevant, please recommend what lens i need to get for it. I dont need a full case full of different lens, id much rather prefer having 1 max 2 lens that would work for majority of the time. I am not a pro photographer, nor do i aim to be one. Most of these will be for personal use.
* Needs to be available in the UK. I am UK based, and so would be buying it from a UK online shop (such as amazon, ebuyer, etc). 

Any suggestions/advice/questions/etc please let me know!

1080,"Hi /r/nikon.  A bit of backstory - I've had an old Panasonic with lenses ranging from 24-300 for over a decade and have outgrown it a while ago.  My wife's known about my desire to get a D850 since release, but I kept choosing to be frugal and invest (the option I tend to take instead of nearly all my larger wish-list purchases).  To combat that, she's saved up money behind the scenes and bought me the D850 body herself to surprise me when I get home from my current assignment...which has since been spilled!

We travel a ton, and I love taking pictures of everything from architecture, stars, landscapes, and am also attempting to get after some wildlife/sports (trying to get into racing more).  While I don't typically take a ton of low-light pictures, I have been irritated at the fact that I was unable to in the past, and so am leaning towards f2.8 options.  I also have been trying to force myself to use strictly my 24-70 lens as of late and keep it at around 50, but I do find myself using my higher range lenses to 2-300s.  I would consider myself more of an enthusiast, but I also do have access to very high quality large scale plotter printers (just will have to provide paper) that I would like to use for prints.

I've read a lot of reviews, looked through spreadsheets, and watched various youtube videos and have come up with the following lenses to purchase to have full coverage on nearly all situations:  

Nikon 50 F1.8

Tamron 15-30 F2.8

Tamron 24-70 F2.8

Tamron 70-200 F2.8

...with one small caveat.

While I could afford the above, I don't want to buy stuff just to have it laying around.  Another alternative I am HEAVILY leaning towards is to take out both the 24-70 and 70-200 lenses and pick up a  Nikon 28-300 F3.5-5.6 or maybe even a Sigma 24-105 F4.  I feel the 50 will give me a solid piece for that in-between realm anyways if I do need the lower f stop value. This will also sting (a lot!) less financially and allow me to go a bit more heavy into future lenses - such as a nikon 2-500 if I get out to the racetrack more often, filters, a tripod, and other related tools (not to mention money for those traveling trips!)

1174,"This is my Nikon AF Nikkor 80-200mm f/2.8D ED. 

When I took home this lens a little over a month ago, the poor little thing's autofocus wasn't working. It was stuck in manual-focus mode. The M-A ring was cracked, and it wouldn't budge. The seller probably figured it was crippled for life, so he let it go for $160, listing the lens as manual-focus-only. But I had an inkling I could fix this little guy and help it back to its former glory.

The lens came in the mail two days later. I couldn't wait to take it apart and see what I could do. But I didn't know how. So I scoured the internet for guidance and quickly found [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu4oA2F2v9Y) that walked me through almost a full teardown of the lens. Bracing myself against the possibility that I'd ruin the lens trying to fix it, I started disassembling.

After about an hour of nervous sweat, I finally reached the M-A ring. The source of the trouble was now as clear as day. The former owner (not necessarily the seller) had attempted to mend the cracked ring with superglue—and had only managed to stick it fast to the barrel. It was a few minutes' work to pick out and scrape off the dried glue, which had worked its way far from the location of the crack. When I was done, the M-A ring moved freely once again. Turning it, I could see that the M-A switch mechanism seemed to be working correctly. (The cracked ring was tricky to turn but did not itself prevent operation of the mechanism.) Excitedly, I began putting the beast back together.

When I was nearly done reassembling the lens, something very bad happened. In my haste, I tore the flex cable connecting the lens's CPU to the CPU contacts in the bayonet mount. It was only a partial tear, a single trace severed...but I knew the lens was doomed. Still, I finished putting it back together—what else could i do?—mounted it on my camera, and attempted to use it. I tried using autofocus...

Nothing. No movement. Not a sound. 

Not only was the lens *still* manual-focus only, but as far as the camera was concerned, it no longer registered as a lens. It was now a *non-CPU lens*, like some old manual-focus Nikkor from the days before AF. I would have to enter it in the camera's non-CPU lens database and use it without autofocus, forever.

Right. You know the story doesn't end that way. 

I went out and bought a soldering iron from the local Harbor Freight. A ten-dollar, store-branded, Made in China unit, the only kind they had. And some solder. The COVID-19 lockdown had gone into effect only days before here in L.A., and I was the only customer in the store.

Well, to cut the story short, I got home, took the lens apart enough to expose the torn flex cable, and fixed it with the soldering iron. Success.

And now I have a fully-working, autofocus-capable Nikon 80-200mm f/2.8D ED lens! One of the best-regarded lenses in the long history of the Nikkor line, mine for the bargain price of $160 ($170 including the soldering iron) and a few hours of anxious work.

I have the camera Nikon D7000 and I have the lens Yongnuo 50mm , I have a presentable work but I am tired of the quality, aunto-focus and the noise of the Yongnuo.

I want to have a 24mm - 70mm  and I found a Tokina 28-70 of second hand. I've read about this lens that is more developed for film but also is nice for photography, I am doing more portrait photography and sometimes product photography.

What recommendation do you have about this lens.

Thank you! Tokina AT-X Pro AF 28-70mm 1:2.6-2 8 for Nikon"

I dont care about low light very much which is it's biggest weak point as far as I'm aware. But anyone have it and can take good pictures with it? Did i really completely wasted my money? Should i be disappointed or it's actually good? Is it only good for it's zoom capability? Or manual can be like any other digital camera if you master it.

I don't really do much architecture photography, but I love gimmicky styles and I'm wondering what might be out there. Considering it's not going to be my main pick, I'd like to stay away from the more expensive models.

But they all seem to be pretty pricey, and I don't quite understand these tilt-shift adapters, they all look like they're made to put old non-F mount lenses onto Nikons? Can't find any Nikon-to-Nikon adapters.

So far the most affordable options I've come across are the Nikkor 35mm f/2.8 PC and the Nikkor 35mm f/3.5 PC. They all look much older so I assume they were built for 35mm and I won't have a problem on a full frame. And it looks like the older manual-only ones are the way to go to save a couple hundred for a fun gimmicky lens.

Should I just return this thing and get a Sigma version, cheaper? What am I doing wrong? Suggestions on how can I get the best use out of an almost 2K lens???

I imported and saved a custom picture profile on my Z6. Works perfectly fine. Downloaded, saved in a Nikon&gt;CUSTOMPC folder on the card, and transferred to the camera.

When I try the exact same process on my D850 so that I can have both cameras match, the cards (neither) seem to read any picture profile on my cards. How do I rectify this and actually save this picture profile on the D850? Does anyone have any insight?

I bought my first DSLR last year, and have been loving taking pictures with a ""real camera"".

Currently, I am thinking about the next lenses I want to purchase, and am still a bit doubtful between the AF-S series G and the older AF D series.

Yes, I know the AF won't work, as the body does not have a screw motor. Yet, I learned photography on an ancient Minolta, with manual focus and aperture. I algo find myself manually focusing my 35mm a lot more than letting the camera focus anyway.

But I also read from Ken Rockwell that there may be some incompatibilities regarding metering. But he is the only one who mentions that problem.

And yes, I plan on getting an FX body in the future, so I have no reason to restrict myself to DX or Gelded lenses.

1345,"I’m currently on a D3200 APSC camera looking to upgrade and all my lenses are F-amount. I know there’s an adapter but some of my lenses are vintage AI/AI-S lenses and I’m not sure if they will cause some kind of vignetting on the Z6 full frame. I like the idea of full frame but haven’t experimented with it at all.

As far as video is concerned, they seem pretty comparable - 21 vs 23 mp, 4K at 30, 1080 at 60 and so on. This gets at the heart of my conflict - for half the price, a D7500 offers competitive performance  and no need for a lens adapter. 

A big pro of the Z6 is that it shoots in ProRes Raw / Log. I have a canon EOS that shoots C-Log MLV RAW and I love what I can do with it in post.

But the D7500 offers way longer battery performance and I’ve heard it has good dynamic range to the point where I can shoot in a flat profile and get plenty of information in to the sensor to produce great footage. And again, at half the price of the Z6.

I’m interested to know if anyone else has used these cameras and can offer a genuine comparison beyond just specs - is it worth the extra money to invest in a Z6 or should I upgrade to the D7500 for now and put the difference towards better lighting equipment / lenses and upgrade the body again down the road when specs and prices change?",0,Nikon D7500 or Z6 for video work?,"I’m currently on a D3200 APSC camera looking to upgrade and all my lenses are F-amount.

1381,"Hi guys.

I’m thinking of getting my dad a camera as he turned 70 recently and we weren’t able to hold a party or even meet up due to coronavirus. 

He is the one who sparked my interest in photography when I was younger, took me to photographic exhibitions, gave me my first SLR, etc.

I don’t have a lot of budget, and he s definitely not technology well versed, indeed he does struggle to use a computer or anything digital, however he’s not an idiot and I feel that with a bit of help and coaching I could teach him to use lightroom and a DSLR. He did do a college course in photography when I was a kid, so he should remember some of the basics, shutter speed/aperture etc, or at least be able to relearn them. This was in the 80’s, though, so digital did not exist. 

I thought it would be a nice gift as he has a previous interest, and it would be something we can do together sometimes, visit places to take pictures, etc. Might give him a new hobby and encourage him to get out and about as well, which at 70 is a good thing, the more excercise the better. 

So on to camera choice then. I’ve got a pretty limited budget, so going second hand is the best route, I’m thinking something like a d80 or a d200, which can be bought from a retailer here in the UK for £60 and £78 respectively. They give a 24 month warranty on everything they sell so that takes away some of the worries about buying used as well. 

So my question is, (at long last) which would be the best choice for him? I know the d200 is the better camera, but is it extra features and resolution he’ll never need/use, or indeed would it be better to go with something cheaper and more ‘consumer’ and possibly easier to use like a d70, d3100 etc? 

I will probably pair it with a kit lens or a 35-70 as I have one of those I bought recently but realised I don’t really need/have much use for. 

Thoughts and suggestions appreciated!",0,Advice on camera for my Dad (70yrs),"Hi guys.

I thought it would be a nice gift as he has a previous interest, and it would be something we can do together sometimes, visit places to take pictures, etc. Might give him a new hobby and encourage him to get out and about as well, which at 70 is a good thing, the more excercise the better. 

So on to camera choice then. I’ve got a pretty limited budget, so going second hand is the best route, I’m thinking something like a d80 or a d200, which can be bought from a retailer here in the UK for £60 and £78 respectively. They give a 24 month warranty on everything they sell so that takes away some of the worries about buying used as well. 

So my question is, (at long last) which would be the best choice for him? I know the d200 is the better camera, but is it extra features and resolution he’ll never need/use, or indeed would it be better to go with something cheaper and more ‘consumer’ and possibly easier to use like a d70, d3100 etc? 

I will probably pair it with a kit lens or a 35-70 as I have one of those I bought recently but realised I don’t really need/have much use for.

1382,"Hey guys! 

I’m looking to switch upgrade from my D800 which I currently use. I usually shoot portraits, landscape and street photography. I don’t really shoot anything video like. 

I use a Sigma 14-24mm f2.8 Art, Sigma 35mm f1.4 Art and Nikon 85mm f1.8 G lens. 

I don’t want to repurchase lenses but I also know the the new line of lenses for the mirrorless camera are amazing, which is something I can look into if I do go mirrorless. I did tons of research and still can’t decide between which camera body to upgrade to. I know the Z7 has a minor issue with the battery life and I can easily fix it with a purchasing a spare battery. If I do switch over to the Z7, would my lenses still be useable with the FTZ adapter? I love my D800 and how it’s built, but it’s a bit sluggish when I need to carry it around during my trips abroad. But that’s just a minor issue. 

I guess my main concerns lie on the idea of buying and selling current lenses. I fear of spending more money to switch lens if I do go mirrorless or the lens won’t be able to work. Should I upgrade to the Z7 and keep the current lenses I have now and is a FTZ adapter or upgrade to a D850? 

Thank you!

1383,"I'm new to cameras but want to learn. I'd like to mostly take landscape pictures, selfies and low light stuff, such as sunsets. The one thing holding me back is I'd also like to very potentially do low light videos and I've been struggling with the right camera for this. I like to do some exploring and sometimes (or often) it's pretty dark, my GoPro 7 black is horrible at night. 

The 5500 has better low light (no clue why) and is cheaper but lacks more convenient NFC and Bluetooth features that I would probably use very often to have pictures sent to my phone. I will mostly be editing photos on my phone, I don't have a desk and my laptop is a hassle to set up. 

Other comparable better low light cameras lack too many good features that the 5600 has. I considered the 7500 but it's too expensive. A feature I really would prefer to not give up is the articulated screen of the 5600, it will be a major boon for me. 

Ideally my budget is around $600 but I can probably stretch another $100 give or take, I will 99% most likely be buying used so I look at Ebay and Offerup etc for good bundles. 

Videography on't be my main focus, but I'd like to be able to use it when I want to and not have to shell out another $600 for a video camera specifically or carry two with me everywhere.",0,Almost settled on a 5600 but I am looking for more opinons,"I'm new to cameras but want to learn.

I'm a mostly outdoor photographer, and I'll often switch between wildlife, flower macros, insects, and landscapes all in one go, and I think the z50+ftz with my current lense selection will be a great upgrade, especially with the kit lenses being pretty good apparently. I also love the idea of exposure preview, I already know that will save me a lot of headache when taking pictures of stuff that likes to run away before I get my settings just right 😁.

Now, astrophotography has been really interesting to me for years, but I never felt like my d3200 was very good at it. I have a Tokina 11-16 f2.8 that's supposed to be the cream of the crop as far as cheap, super-wide, fast lenses go, but even with that I can't seem to get a halfway decent star photo without star trails and/or excessive noise. The stars just don't show up as well as they seem to for other people with other cameras. Maybe it's the d3200's anti-aliasing filter, maybe it's the sensor, maybe it's some setting that I've missed, maybe it's Maybelline, I'm not sure.

Can't find much online, and don't want to end up getting cheated by not being able to repair my camera through the ""official channels"". 

For reference, the article in question is [here](https://petapixel.com/2016/05/20/nikon-now-allows-grey-market-camera-repairs-us/)

Any and all help is much appreciated! Thanks! D810 grey market repair questions"

1431,"Wanted to preface this post by stating that I'm an amateur photographer with maybe a year of true experience shooting with purpose and editing in post, sharing my photos etc. I'm a college student workin multiple jobs, so I have some income I can put to good use. I currently shoot on my dad's old Sony CyberShot DSC-RX100 (Original Model) and it definitely gets the job done, however I've shown my pictures to strangers, friends, and family and they've all said many of the shots were remarkable and that I should take it on as a hobby more seriously. As a result, I've done a fair amount of research and find myself somewhat attached to the Z6 and specifically that beautiful Z glass. I'm fully aware of the fact that gear doesn't dictate your ability as a photographer-- the photographer does-- but I definitely can see in many of my shots I've taken (and missed) on the Sony that it limits me in a way that can warrant an upgrade. I'm just worried that such a jump, straight from a 2012, $300-$400 point and shoot to a $2600 full frame mirrorless would be ""too much"" and that I should ease my way up to higher end cameras. However, I'm quite busy with school and I also don't have *that much* disposable income where I can keep buying new bodies, tons of glass, and invest tons of times to this hobby--at least for the next couple years.

I am not very good in professional terminology.

I wanna make a present to my Gf. 

She has a camera Nikon D5000. 

I am looking for a Lense. 

She is not a professioal photographer, and this lense should not be highly pro.

She needed something that would have fast autofocus(not so fast as for sport events, but fast enough for moving objects)

And possibility to make portraite and landscape photos.

In general: something universal with good autofocus speed.

After disscussing with another photographer i found this one: 

Nikon AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1,8G

1590,"Halloa!

I recently purchased a Nikon D850. Overall, love the camera. However, I am not getting anywhere close to the advertised battery life of 1,840 shots. I'm lucky if I break 500. 

I'm old school -- mostly use the viewfinder, not taking any video. I keep the camera in airplane mode. I'm using EN-EL15b batteries. I have tried with two different batteries, fully charged. The lenses I've been using are non-VR. 

My shutter count is 1,260 and I'm on my fourth charge. So it seems to be improving?

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this a defect? Are there any other settings I should be changing?

The clear and clean images taken with it are astounding. Since I mainly photographs animals, my subjects are usually farther than I’d like them to be unless they are animals I work with. Having seen some finches in my neighborhood, I tested it out on them. If they are within the range of 10 feet at least, I am able to capture them so well that you can actually make out the red markings on their faces. It does become a bit harder when they are in trees and appear to be the same size as the leaves due to the depth perception, making it a bit difficult to focus on they unless you solely use single point. But luckily was able to try it out on my animal patients at work and it’s a beast of a lens. The headshots come out so well, blurring out the environment and even their body given the angle they are shot in. Overall, I’m really excited to keep using this lens and it’s a keeper if you plan to get one :)",0,Mini recap on the 85mm f/1.8 S lens,"Having had this lens for a bit over a day and taken some sample photos, it’s proving itself more than it’s worth to be part of my travel kit.

If they are within the range of 10 feet at least, I am able to capture them so well that you can actually make out the red markings on their faces. It does become a bit harder when they are in trees and appear to be the same size as the leaves due to the depth perception, making it a bit difficult to focus on they unless you solely use single point. But luckily was able to try it out on my animal patients at work and it’s a beast of a lens. The headshots come out so well, blurring out the environment and even their body given the angle they are shot in. Overall, I’m really excited to keep using this lens and it’s a keeper if you plan to get one :) Mini recap on the 85mm f/1.8 S lens"

1648,"Hi. Just purchased a Nikon DF. Now I wonder how to install those Nikon picture controls.

Here are my steps:

1. Format the memory card in camera.
2. When the memory card is plugged in into my laptop, through Windows Explorer I can see a memory card labeled ""NIKON DF"".There's an empty folder named DCIM and a NIKON001.DSC file. Seems fine.
3. In the root directory of the memory card, create a directory called NIKON. Then create another directory called CUSTOMPC, inside NIKON.
4. Grab some presets from [nikonpc.com](https://nikonpc.com) and put them inside CUSTOMPC directory
5. 5. Put the memory card in the camera. Go to Shooting Menu -&gt; Manage Picture Control -&gt; Load/save -&gt; Copy to camera. Result: **""No picture control file found on memory card""**

1650,"Hi Guys, 

Getting back into photography after about a decade away. Decided to treat myself to a used D600 with a really low shutter count from MBP, got it for 389 which I don't think is too bad, according to them its in near mint condition. Shutter count is just over 14k. I know its not the newest camera in the world but my previous DSLR was a Canon EOS 350D, and prior to that a Pentax P30T film camera, and prior to that a K1000, so I don't change cameras or brands too often.. lol Anyway compared to those, from the reviews i've seen, this thing is the starship enterprise. It shoots video! An SLR that shoots video! That's where I'm at, technology wise. I learned onbasic  film cameras (I'm 37) so all I really use is manual mode, most of the time. 

Anyway, in the interceding years between the 350d and now i've pretty much lost all of my camera stuff, there were a few rough years in there but things are much better now. Used to have a bunch of m42 lenes, remote triggers, a slightly decent flash, a nice nifty fifty prime, all gone now. I still have my camera body and the 18-55 kit lens and a 55-200, but this time I really, really wanted full frame, and I was already thinking Nikon even before I realised that EF-S lenses arent compatible with full frame canon's. I was torn between the 6D and the d600 for a while, but I've always fancied nikon gear so I've finally made the switch. 

Along with the camera body, I also ordered literally the cheapest nikon lens MPB had, basically an 18-55 kit lens. It's DX so I am expecting not to be able to use it fully wide, although ive seen posts that say around 22mm you just get some vignetting rather than the telescope effect, I can live with that for now while I figure out what lens to get next. I just wanted something, anything, so that when the camea arrived, I can actually take pictures. A body without a lens isn't good for much unless you want to reinvent pinhole photography. Although, that could be an interesting idea...! I sorely want a nice prime 50mm, and something super wide like an 11mm, most of what I shoot will be landscape photography. I need a tripod as well because I know my Joby Gorillapod ain't gonna cut it for long. But, budget is a thing and so... patience will also now have to be a thing. I even need a camera bag, lol. But I have a good rucksack, for now ;) 

Camera should arrive Tuesday or before and I am really looking forward to it. 

That's about it! Just wanted to say hello, I live on the border between Norfolk and Cambs in the UK, if anyone is local and wants to say hello back!

Well done and thank you to everyone who participated! Great job in self isolating everyone, it's all for a good cause!

At this stage I can’t say there’s any prizes, other than that sweet, sweet comment karma, but for the redditors mentioned above, great work!

# This month’s topic is: Subject Isolation

COVID-19 is still the hot topic in the news lately, and since everyone did a great job **staying at home** for the April assignment, I thought I would continue the theme but giving it a twist – subject isolation. For those who don't know, subject isolation is a photography technique where basically the entire focus of the photo is on the subject itself; the background just ""fade away"" either into a blur or to black. It's the quintessential photo technique that gives the 'bokeh' look when you are taking a portrait shot, for example. So slap on your fastest lens and let's see what you can create!

If you want to kick this up a notch, I'll also accept just **isolation** as the theme, if you are tired of taking shots of the subject photographically isolated, as it's a common theme.

The photo you share with us **must be taken during the current month**; after all, the point of this assignment is to get you, the photographer, out there and taking photos!

It would be great if we can all stick to the following points:

* Please submit only one photo per assignment – obviously your best one!
* **Your assignment submission must be taken during the current month.**
* Upload to your Flickr account with EXIF data, or you can upload to Imgur and add the list of gear you used in your comment underneath the link
* It goes with saying – photo must be taken with some sort of Nikon photography equipment. Whether that’s a Nikon 1, DSLR (with a Nikon lens or otherwise), Z-body mirrorless, bridge camera or Coolpix camera, or a Nikon lens on another manufacturer’s body, is all acceptable.
* Images submitted to the assignment must be Safe For Work (SFW)
* Feel free to comment on other people’s submissions. Of course, any comments placed need to follow the subreddit rules (see sidebar)

We’ve all been beginners at one stage in our lives, so don’t be intimidated with more seasoned photogs, all submissions are most welcome!

Maybe I’m just getting use to the increased sharpness in comparison to my Nikon D4 but its not so much sharp as it is noise/grain.  I shouldn’t be seeing any noise at ISO 125, but maybe its just an increase in detail i am getting use to? Its very subtle but I’m wondering if maybe its something internally i can change? Almost every photo i have to do some sort of noise reduction at around 20-25%. Indoors, daylight, with flash, you name it. 
Again i might just be used to the look from my D4 but wanted to double check if anyone else has had similar issues. Nikon d5 noise"

Hopefully this is the right place.

I've been looking to get 1 or 2 speedlights for my Nikon D3400. I'm just looking to get an average flash nothing special as of now.

My first issue I'm coming across is since my D3400 doesn't have commander mode(?) I'm unable to use a flash wirelessly.

My next issue is that all of the wireless flash triggers I've found either are confirmed to not work with the D3400 or are not confirmed to work.

Does anyone have experience with this camera and wireless triggers/speedlights?

The Altura and neewer are confirmed, as far as I know, to not work.
Some places say the Yongnuo 622N works some places say it doesn't. And it's like that for others I've seen.

I've also looked at the Godox triggers. But still unsure if it works with D3400.

1700,"I've just made a huge leap in my gear from a D3300 to a D850. With my D3300, I used the 18-55mm kit lens as my go-to for most shooting situations.

I take my camera hiking and backpacking on a weekly basis (utilising the Peak Design Capture Clip) and mainly shoot landscape, though I also adore tiny details like succulents on the side of the trail and will attempt to shoot wildlife now and then if it crosses my path.

I know it's impossible to translate, but I'm looking for a lens to fill the void but perform on the level the D850 deserves. I've obtained a 24-70mm f/2.8E, which I chose because it has VR (and when you're hiking hard and you spot something to shoot, you don't have the steadiest of hands...), should perform well in low light, and has a comparable zoom range to what I'm used to. While I did have concerns about the size when looking at it on the internet, those concerns kicked into high gear when I received it.

I'll be honest, I'm not exactly delicate with my gear--using the PD clip, it hangs on the outside of my packs for quick access and I do scramble off-trail quite a bit. This lens will probably get smacked up pretty hard the first time I try a scrambling stunt, and heaven knows I don't want to kill my (very expensive) gear the first time out.

I'm sure I'm asking the impossible...but do you have any lenses you can recommend for this situation? Something smaller, but versatile (I am willing to lose a little bit of zoom range, but not looking for any primes at this point), and good quality?

I have a Z6 and have the 24-70mm standard lens.

I am thinking about picking up the Z50 as a back up, plus, I miss the automatic features my D3300 had and I have heard the Z50 has them.

The Z50 comes with DX lenses rather than FX lenses though.

If I use a DX lens on the Z6, its crops the photo.

This made me wonder how compatible these cameras really are when it comes to lenses.

I assumed the two cameras were compatible and similar, but when I found out about the DX lens, I was hoping people here could shed some light on this.

I would also like the Z50 camera for a compact, portable camera that I can take to parties and when I travel,do I'd like a quality, all around lens on it.

Also, do they use the same battery and memory card?

1768,"I just treated myself a Nikon D7500, and I'm on the search for my first L-Bracket. I have no previous experience using L-Brackets, so I'd like some input from people with more experience.

Requirements:
1. Must be compatible with Peak Design Capture. Preferably specifically designed for it, or by screwing on their plate to the bottom.
2. Price: preferably sub $100, but I'm definitely open for up to $200 for the right thing.
3. I do not prioritize good access to the ports on the left side, they are very seldomly used by me.

Kirk or Promaster I expect to fit like a glove on the camera body, but I will need to put the Peak Design plate to the bottom of them, which will probably be a bit clumsy.

But looking at pictures of other people mounting their L-Brackets, it doesn't seem all that uncommon to have it extend a bit on the side? Why is that, is it for easier access to the ports?

I have been eyeing two models mainly, and reading up quite a bit on them, however I’d like some help from the community to come to an educated decision. 

First of all, here’s a summary of the differences:
https://cameradecision.com/compare/Nikon-D3500-vs-Nikon-D7100

These are some of the listings I’ve found:

1.	D7100 body €270 (optional AF-S DX Nikkor 18-140mm f/3.5 – 5.6G ED VR for additional €100), shutter count 7000
2.	D7100 + AF-S DX Nikkor 18-105mm f/3.5 – 5.6 G ED VR €370, shutter count 200
3.	D3500 + AF-P DX Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5 – 5.6 G VR + AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G €260, unknown shutter count 
4.	D3500 + AF-P DX Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5 – 5.6 G VR €260, shutter count 500


I’m interested in street, landscape, a bit of portrait, and sport - more or less in that order.   Bit more day shots than night. Some video would be nice as well, but I know neither camera is particularly suited for it. 

I’m drawn to the 3500 for the battery (1550 shots vs 7100’s 950) and light weight (365g vs 7100’s 676g), and to the 7100 for the shutter speed (1/8000 vs 3500’s 1/4000) and autofocus points (51 vs 3500’s 11). It feels like a convenience (3500) vs performance/features (7100) situation to me. 

Since I’m a beginner and interested in a bit of everything, a kit lens is probably not a horrible idea. I’ve heard bad things about the 18-55, but #3 with its additional 35mm f1.8 is tempting. All in all listings #1 and #3 are the most tempting. 

I would love to get some feedback from those of you who have experience with either (or both!) camera, as well as some general advice about the lenses - should I get an alternative to the standard kit lenses? How much more performance can I reasonably expect from D7100 over D3500? Will I notice? What about the noise levels and 3500’s ISO range advantage (100-25600 vs 7100’s 100-6400)?

All the pictures I took were coming out completely black. It took me a bit to realize the exposure meter was all the way to the left and under exposed. I tried fixing it by adjusting the exposure but that did nothing. I found that if I slowed the shutter speed, it helped but still distorted the pictures as it was set to ridiculously slow for these well lit places. It didn’t matter if I was outside in sunlight, on a stage lit with LEDs, or just a regular bedroom, it kept taking pictures super dark.

However I noticed it’s only an issue when I shoot in manual. My lens is fine, I film with it all the time. If I shoot in (P) or (A) or anything other than manual, it works but I personally prefer shooting in manual since I have more liberty.

I found that if I slowed the shutter speed, it helped but still distorted the pictures as it was set to ridiculously slow for these well lit places. It didn’t matter if I was outside in sunlight, on a stage lit with LEDs, or just a regular bedroom, it kept taking pictures super dark.

However I noticed it’s only an issue when I shoot in manual. My lens is fine, I film with it all the time. If I shoot in (P) or (A) or anything other than manual, it works but I personally prefer shooting in manual since I have more liberty.

Anyone else had this issue and fixed it? Or anyone know what I might have done wrong? Thanks! Exposure Issues?"

Afaict, the chip itself works, the contacts simply don't connect and I don't see a way to open it up...",0,Repair/replace cpu connector on older nikon AF lens,"So, got a couple of lenses of a family member to sell... One of these was a Nikon 85mm 1.8 AF. AF did not work on my D7100, I noticed a crack in the cpu connector on the mount. After carefully gluing it with super glue, it sat tight but still no connection. Took it apart and tested connectivity and pin 3 and 4 don't pass any signal to the chip. Contact spray did nothing.

1871,"Hi all, just got a brand new (according to the listing) 85mm 1.8g in today and the lense makes a loud squeaking noise when focusing, both in manual and auto focus modes. It only squeaks within the focus range, if i continue to manually turn the focus ring beyond or below the focus range the squeak goes away instantly.

I've never experienced this before so i did some research and apparently its a sign the silent wave motor is going bad? Which is perplexing to me since it is apparently brand new..

Im just wondering, has anyone else experienced squeaky lenses when focusing? Also, is this even something that can happen or that anyone here has heard of happening with a new lens?",0,Brand new lens squeak.,"Hi all, just got a brand new (according to the listing) 85mm 1.8g in today and the lense makes a loud squeaking noise when focusing, both in manual and auto focus modes.

Would Nikon still today honor the recall and provide free repair/replacement of the shutter for a 2nd hand purchase affected by either of the problems?

It has/still is serving me well but I would like to replace it with something newer that will alleviate some of its shortcomings. I want to note that this is very much a hobby for me and not something I am looking to invest big money in. Even if I could extend my budget to buy an FX camera, I am already invested in DX lenses so want/need to stay in that realm. I'll give a listing below of the shortcomings I have with the current body, followed by what I am considering. 

* Low light performance is pretty garbage in my opinion. Anything shot past 800 ISO is unusable and even that is pushing it. I am also a hobbyist and am not and experienced pro, this could maybe rectified with more knowledge and skill.
* I would like the ability to take video
* Bigger screen would be nice

* When I do need to crop a photo down, having only 10.2 MP to work with is a limiting factor sometimes.

Thank you all for any help given!",0,Help me pick a new (to me) camera body.,"Looking to upgrade my camera finally. I am still using a D200 that I have had for probably 6 or 7 years. It has/still is serving me well but I would like to replace it with something newer that will alleviate some of its shortcomings. I want to note that this is very much a hobby for me and not something I am looking to invest big money in. Even if I could extend my budget to buy an FX camera, I am already invested in DX lenses so want/need to stay in that realm. I'll give a listing below of the shortcomings I have with the current body, followed by what I am considering. 

* Low light performance is pretty garbage in my opinion. Anything shot past 800 ISO is unusable and even that is pushing it. I am also a hobbyist and am not and experienced pro, this could maybe rectified with more knowledge and skill.
* I would like the ability to take video
* Bigger screen would be nice
* SD cards would be nice as well

Currently, there I found some nice deals on SB-400 (70 - 75 EUR) and SB-600 (60 EUR) . 

1. Has anybody experience with those 2 flashes? How was it?
2. Are they good for my D3300?
3. Between the 2 flashes - which one is better?

All suggestions and input are more than welcome.

1979,"Hey guys, I’m relatively new to photography (7-8 months of regular shooting), where I shoot primarily wildlife (I’m a bird nerd sadly). I have a d3500 + 70-300mm f/4.5 non-VR, and I’m looking for an upgrade, to hopefully keep me relevant in the long term. 

I want a bit more reach, so I’m looking into getting the AF-S Nikkor 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR.
